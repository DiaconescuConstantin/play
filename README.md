# jsgo.io playground

Edit and run Go code, compiled to JS using GopherJS, supporting arbitrary import paths!

https://play.jsgo.io/

### Features
* Share your code
* Load any package
* Add multiple files

Imports are cached on the client, so compiling the second time is quick.

### Stability
Pre-alpha! Will probably break.
